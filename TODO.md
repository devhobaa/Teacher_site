# Design Improvement Plan - Make Design Wonderful and User-Friendly

## Information Gathered
- **base.html**: Main layout with header, footer, extensive CSS using gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **register.html**: Registration form with modern styling, floating animations, and form validation
- **courses.html**: Course listing with cards, features section, and call-to-action
- **index.html**: Homepage with hero, features, about, courses preview, testimonials, and CTA sections
- All templates use consistent orange gradient color scheme, Arabic fonts (Amiri, Cairo), RTL direction, and modern UI patterns

## Plan
- [ ] Update base.html: Refine typography hierarchy, improve button styles, enhance spacing and shadows
- [ ] Update register.html: Improve form input focus states, button animations, and layout spacing
- [ ] Update courses.html: Polish course cards with better hover effects and consistent spacing
- [ ] Update index.html: Enhance hero section, feature cards, and overall visual hierarchy

## Dependent Files to be edited
